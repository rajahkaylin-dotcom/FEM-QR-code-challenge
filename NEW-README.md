# My experience with the QR code project

## Day 1 - 17/02/2026

- The project got off to a good start, the boilerplate was done quickly (I'm doing everything from scratch on every project instead of copy pasting boiler plate in order to maximize my learning).
- created a header, main and footer section and nested a div within a div within the main section, leaving the header and footer blank for future edits or additions.
- Started styling the body background in CSS as well as the outer div container, but hit a roadblock while trying to figure out how to properly center the div.
- Started learning flexbox in order to meet the previously mentioned challenge, but cannot seem to get the CSS to work properly, using html and css validators to look for broken code.
- Taking a small break to figure out flexbox then returning.
